# Execution Instructions for Bank Accounts Conundrum (C/POSIX)

This program was developed and tested in a Windows environment using the **MinGW/GCC** toolchain, accessed via PowerShell/Command Prompt.

The use of POSIX threads (`pthread.h`) requires specific linker flags.

## 1. Prerequisites

A C compiler (GCC) and the POSIX threads library must be available. On Windows, this is typically provided by MinGW or MSYS2.

## 2. Compilation

The compilation must explicitly link the POSIX threads library and specify the console subsystem to resolve linker errors (`undefined reference to 'WinMain'`).

Use the provided `Makefile` or the following direct command:

```bash
# Compilation Command:
gcc main.c -o bank_c -mconsole -pthread

# Execution Command
./bank_c
